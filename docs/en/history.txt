a:T7df,<div class='popup-item'> <h3>Fender stratocaster</h3> <p>Fender Musical Instruments Corporation was founded by Clarence 'Leo' Fender in California in 1946.            In 1950, the Fender Esquire electric guitar with a single pickup was released. Based on this guitar, the Fender Broadcaster with two pickups was developed in 1951. This guitar was renamed Telecaster and today is one of the most popular guitars among professional musicians.            In the same year, Leo Fender invented the first ever mass-produced electric bass guitar, the Fender Precision Bass, which is still the benchmark bass guitar for many musicians and manufacturers today.            In 1954, Fender released its first Stratocaster, a legendary guitar that revolutionized the world of music. The shape of this guitar set the trends of guitar production for many years to come.            In the following years several models of guitars were developed, most of which are still produced today: 1958 - Fender Jazzmaster, 1960 - Fender Jazz Bass, 1961 - Fender Bass V, 1961 - Fender Bass VI, 1962 - Fender Jaguar, 1964 - Fender Mustang, 1965 - Fender Coronado, 1987 - Fender Performer, 1993 - Fender Prodigy, 1994 - Fender Jag-Stang, 1995 - Fender Roscoe Beck Bass, 2005 - Fender Jaguar Baritone Custom.        In 1987, Fender opened a factory 180 miles south of Los Angeles in Ensenada, Mexico. There they began producing standard model guitars sold at low prices. The U.S. factory was left to produce expensive, high quality models and started the Fender Custom Shop, a division that made high-end instruments, custom guitars, reissues of classic Fender models and signature models for famous musicians.            In 1991, Leo Fender died of complications from Parkinson's disease.            In 2006, Fender celebrated its 60th anniversary.        In October 2007, Fender and Kaman announced that Fender was acquiring Kaman Music Corporation, a division of Kaman Music Corporation founded in 1966, for $117 million.        </p> </div>b:Te10,<div class='popup-item'> <h3>Vintage Fender Stratocaster guitar</h3> <p>A vintage guitar is an old guitar that is usually sought out and kept by avid collectors or musicians. The term can mean that the instrument is simply old, or that it is sought after for its timbral qualities, cosmetic appearance, or historical significance.        </p> <p>In the 1920s and 1930s, Gibson, National and Martin developed higher quality acoustic, mandolin and resonator guitars that later became highly sought after vintage acoustic guitars.                During this period, Gibson used nomenclature related to the price of the guitar. For example, in 1938, a J-35 cost $35 and a J-55 cost $55. The J stood for Jumbo.                During World War II, metal shortages in the United States led Gibson and Martin to produce acoustic guitars without metal rods. Therefore, guitars manufactured before December 7, 1941 became more in demand. These are known as 'pre-war' Gibson and Martin.                Most of the workers at the Kalamazoo factory during World War II were women. They developed a smaller guitar, the LG-2 acoustic, which became one of Gibson's best-selling guitars for the next two decades.                During the emergence of popular music in the 1950s and 1960s, Gibson, the new Fender company and, to a lesser extent, Gretsch and Rickenbacker began producing high quality electric guitars. After the heyday of the Beatles in 1964, Gretsch and Rickenbacker production increased significantly.                It was this increase in production after 1965, combined with the sale of Fender to CBS, that led to a gradual decline in the quality of electric instruments, and therefore the price of vintage guitars after 1965 drops dramatically depending on the company and model of the product.                Already in the 1970s, musicians and collectors began to realize the value of old instruments. The rise of mass production of acoustic and electric guitars in that era allowed the quality of workmanship and materials of older instruments to be emphasized. Historians such as George Gruen helped determine the monetary value and sound quality of these guitars for collectors and musicians alike. Norman Harris of California began collecting pre-war Martin acoustic guitars.                Examples of famous vintage electric guitars include the Fender Stratocaster and Telecaster from the 1950s and 1960s, as well as the Gibson Les Paul.                 A good example is the 1961 Fender Stratocaster that belonged to James Bond guitarist Vic Flick.           In 1961, Vic's famous electric guitar was bought new for about $200-$250. Today, the piece is worth close to $100,000 USD, partly due to the fact that it is owned by a recording musician.                Old electric guitars have generally become desirable, including 'budget brands' such as Harmony, Danelectro and Kay.                Examples of famous vintage acoustic guitars include pre-1960s Martin and Gibson models, as well as Recording Kings from the 1930s and others.                The value of vintage guitars has increased significantly over the past thirty years, and some consider them a stable long-term investment.                Generally, those electric guitars that were played by rock and roll stars, including Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Angus Young, and Jimmy Page, are considered more desirable.                In particular, a late 1950s Gibson Les Paul made of Honduran mahogany and Brazilian rosewood is considered the most collectible vintage guitar on the market today.        </p> </div>c:T1919,<div class='popup-item'> <h3>Gibson Les Paul</h3> <p>Gibson (Gibson) is an American guitar manufacturer. The company's products can also be seen under the Epiphone, Kramer Guitars, Valley Arts, Tobias, Steinberger and Kalamazoo brands. In addition to guitars, Gibson makes pianos (a division of Baldwin Piano), drums, and additional equipment.            Company founder Orville Gibson made mandolins in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in the early 1900s. Modeled after the violin, he created a guitar with a convex deck, also known as an 'archtop'. Orville's instruments were louder and more durable than other modern fretted instruments, and soon musicians were demanding more than he could build in his workshop. By 1930, the company was producing flat-top guitars (aka 'flattops', Engl-flat-top) and hollow-body guitars, which were popularized by Charles Krischen. In the early 1950s, Gibson released the Les Paul, the first solid-body guitar. After Norlin Corporation took over ownership of Gibson in 1960, the company's success and product quality began to decline dramatically until 1986, when it was bought out by the current owners. Gibson Guitar is a closed joint stock company, headed by Henry Juszkiewicz and David Berryman.        </p> <p>Orville Gibson (born 1856) began by making mandolins in Kalamazoo, Michigan. His mandolins were different in shape, had a darker sound, and were easier to make. They were patented in 1898, and in 1918 Orville died of endocarditis. The Orville by Gibson brand, sold in Japan, is named in his honor.        </p> <h4> 1902-1950 </h4> <p>Gibson mandolin at the Glinka Museum of Musical Culture (with a Soviet-made pickup made at the Magneton factory in Leningrad) In 1880, Gibson Mandolin-Guitar Mfg. Co, Ltd. was officially registered as a manufacturer of musical instruments. At first, the design of all instruments was based only on Orville Gibson's designs, but fearing to fall behind the new trends, in 1919 the company invited designer Lloyd Loar to collaborate. As a result, in the 20s Gibson produced many innovations in the design of guitars and mandolins. In 1922, the Gibson F5 mandolin model was invented, which later became known as the 'bluegrass mandolin'. Soon after, Gibson became the leading manufacturers of archtop guitars. In 1924, Loar left the company.            In the 1930s, Gibson began to show interest in producing electric guitars. In 1936, they released the first electric 'Spanish' model, the ES-150. The first electric banjos and mandolins and an electric Hawaiian steele guitar also appeared.            During World War II, due to lack of materials, Gibson suspended production. During all this time, only a few instruments could be made from improvised materials. Instead, the company worked for the war effort. In 1944, the declining company was acquired by Maurice Henry Berlin's Chicago Musical Instrument Company, who was Gibson's CEO until 1969, making it the largest manufacturer of electric guitars and plucked instruments in the world.            In 1949, the ES-175 model was released, which can still be seen on sale today.        </p> <h4>Gibson and Ted McCarthy </h4> <p>In 1948, Gibson welcomed a man with vast experience in the music industry, Ted McCarthy. During his tenure (1950-1966) the company greatly expanded its product range. The first significant innovation was the Les Paul guitar. In 1950 Gibson decided to make the first guitar with a solid deck. The design of such a guitar was made by guitarist Les Paul, and in 1952 it was released for sale.            In the mid 50's the 'Thinline' series (literally 'thin line') was made. At that time, many guitarists were dissatisfied with the large size of the archtops and were looking for smaller models. The first such model was the Byrdland, which at first was a slimline L-5 model, custom-made for guitarists Billy Byrd and Hank Garland. The fingerboard was later shortened. The models were very well liked by musicians, and they were soon released for sale. The ES-350T and ES-225T models were made as a cheaper alternative.            In the late 50s, McCarthy decided to break the stereotype that Gibson was a conservative company, making only traditionally shaped instruments. In 1958, two new models with a new design were released: Explorer and Flying V. In the beginning, the 'tricked-out' guitars sold very poorly, and only in the 60s-70s they were released on the market again and began to enjoy popularity among musicians.            In 1961, due to the increased interest in 'double cut' guitars (two-cut guitars), a new model was introduced.The musician Les Paul disliked the model and did not want his name to be associated with it. So the new shape became known as SG (solid guitar). The guitarist even canceled his contract with the company, and only in 1968 he reconciled with it. Since then, the legendary instrument has been available in various versions.        </p> <h4>Since the 70s </h4> <p>From 1974 to 1984, the production of Gibson guitars moved from Kalamazoo to Nashville (Tennessee). In January 1986, Henry Juszkiewicz, David Berryman, and Gary Zebrowski took over the company. Later, new plants were opened in Memphis and Bozeman.            In 1994, Henry Juszkiewicz began developing a program that was profitable and non-damaging to the nature of wood delivery. Attempts were made to partner with Rainforest Alliances Smart Wood. Gibson also supported Greenpeace and many other similar organizations. Результатом сотрудничества стала модель Gibson Les Paul Exotic Smartwood, выпущенная в 1998 году. Новая гитара, изготовленная из лучших сортов дерева, стоила $1299, и часть этой суммы переходила к Rainforest Alliances Smart Wood.            2 мая 2018 года Gibson объявил о банкротстве, однако по итогам судебного заседания, прошедшего 2 октября того же года в американском Суде по делам о банкротстве, компания Gibson осталась на плаву, благодаря прощению долгов на общую сумму 500 миллионов долларов, смене руководства компании и инвестициям в размере $70 млн. </p> </div>d:T110d,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Ibanez JS1200</h4> <p> Ibanez (アイバニーズ, Aibanīzu) is a Japanese guitar brand owned by Hoshino Gakki. Based in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, Hoshino Gakki was one of the first Japanese musical instrument companies to gain a significant share of imported guitar sales in the United States and Europe, and was the first guitar brand to mass produce seven-string and eight-string guitars. Ibanez manufactures effects, accessories, amplifiers, and instruments in Japan, China, Indonesia, and the United States (in a custom workshop in Los Angeles). As of 2017, there are approximately 165 models of bass guitars, 130 acoustic guitars and over 300 electric guitars on the market. After Gibson and Fender, Ibanez is considered the third largest guitar brand.        </p> <p>Hoshino Gakki began in 1908 as the musical instrument division of the Hoshino Shoten chain of bookstores. In 1935, Hoshino Gakki decided to produce Spanish-style acoustic guitars, first using the brand name 'Ibanez Salvador' in honor of Spanish luthier Salvador Ibanez, and then simply 'Ibanez'. Accordingly, in Japan, the brand was originally spelled Ibanyesu (イバニェス) in Japan, reflecting the Spanish pronunciation, and in 1986 changed the spelling to the current name, which is the English pronunciation of Ibanez.            The modern era of Ibanez guitars began in 1957. Ibanez catalogs of the late 1950s and 1960s featured wildly designed guitars made by Kiso Suzuki Violin, Guyatone, and their own Tama factory, founded in 1962. After the Tama factory stopped producing guitars in 1966, Hoshino Gakki contracted with Teisco String Instruments Company to produce Ibanez guitars. After the Teisco String Instrument factory closed in 1970, Hoshino Gakki contracted with FujiGen Gakki to produce Ibanez guitars.            In the 1960s, Japanese guitar makers mostly copied the design of American guitars, and under the Ibanez brand there were copies of Gibson, Fender and Rickenbacker models. This led to what is known as the litigation period.            As a result of the litigation, Hoshino Gakki introduced Ibanez models that were definitely not copies of Gibson or Fender models, such as the Iceman and the Roadstar series. Since then, the company has produced guitars of its own design. The late 1980s and early 1990s were an important period for the Ibanez brand. Hoshino Gakki's collaboration with guitarist Steve Vai led to the introduction of the Ibanez JEM and Ibanez Universe models; following the success of the Roadstar and Iceman models in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hoshino Gakki entered the superstratum market with the RG series, a lower-priced version of the JEM series.            Hoshino Gakki also produced semi-acoustic, nylon and steel acoustic guitars under the Ibanez brand. Most Ibanez guitars were manufactured at the FujiGen guitar factory in Japan until the mid to late 1980s, and since then Ibanez guitars have been produced in other Asian countries such as Korea, China and Indonesia. FujiGen Guitar Factory also produced most of the Roland guitar synthesizers in the early 1980s, including the Stratocaster-style Roland G-505, the two-humbucker Roland G-202 (endorsed by Adrian Bellew, Eric Clapton, Dean Brown, Jeff Baxter, Yannis Spathas, Christoforos Krokidis, Steve Howe, Mike Rutherford, Andy Summers, Neal Schon and Steve Hackett) and the Ibanez X-ING IMG-2010.            Cimar and Starfield were guitar and bass guitar brands owned by Hoshino Gakki. In the 1970s, Hoshino Gakki and Kanda Shokai shared some guitar designs, so some Ibanez and Greco guitars share the same features. Greco versions were sold in Japan, while Ibanez versions were sold outside of Japan. Since 1982, Ibanez guitars have been sold in Japan as well.            Guitar brands such as Antoria and Mann used some of the designs of Ibanez guitars. The Antoria guitar brand was managed by the English company JT Coppock Leeds Ltd. The CSL brand was managed by the English company Charles Summerfield Ltd. Maurice Summerfield of Charles Summerfield Ltd provided Hoshino Gakki with some design ideas and also imported Ibanez and CSL guitars into the UK from 1964 to 1987. The name Maxxas came about because Hoshino Gakki felt the guitar didn't fit into the Ibanez lineup, so Rich Lasner of Hoshino USA called it the Maxxas. </p> </div>e:T1b7e,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Vintage Fender Telecaster Guitar (1952)</h4> <p>The Fender Telecaster is a solid body electric guitar with two pickups made by Fender. Its simple but effective design and revolutionary sound set new directions in electric guitar making and popular music. Introduced for distribution as the Broadcaster in the fall of 1949, it was the first guitar of its kind to be produced on a significant scale. The beginning of its commercial production can be dated back to the spring of 1950, when Fender Esquire models became available. Telecaster production in one form or another has continued unabated since then, making it one of the world's premier solid body electric guitars.        </p> <p>The Fender Telecaster was designed by Leo Fender in the 1940s. Various models of solid body electric guitars were independently created by several makers and companies between 1932 and 1949, but none of them made a significant impact on the market. Leo Fender's Telecaster finally made the solid body electric guitar competitive. One of the first musicians to use the Telecaster (then called the Broadcaster) was Arthur Smith, who recorded 'Guitar Boogie' with it in 1947. Leo Fender owned an electronics repair shop where he first fixed and then designed amplifiers and electromagnetic pickups for musicians - mainly for performers playing semi-acoustic guitars, electric Hawaiian guitars and mandolins. Performers had been switching to electric instruments in search of a louder sound since the second half of the 1920s, and electric semi-acoustic guitars (such as the Gibson ES-150) were common at the time. Until then, tone had never been a major reason for a guitarist to switch to an electric instrument, but in 1943, when Fender and his partner, Doc Kauffman, made a rough wood guitar for a pickup test, local musicians began asking to borrow it for gigs. Its sound was very bright. Fender became interested, and in 1949, when it was already clear that the solid body design offered a huge opportunity for electric musical instruments, but before Spanish guitars of this kind became commercially available (a small company called Audiovox had already tried to offer a solid body electric guitar in the mid-1930s), he created an improved model.            This handmade prototype had many of the features that would later become the hallmarks of the Fender Telecaster. It was made in the spirit of the Hawaiian electric guitars made by Rickenbacker - small, simple blocks of bakelite and aluminum with parts bolted together - only the construction was wood (Rickenbacker, then spelled Rickenbacher, had offered a Spanish electric guitar with a bakelite body in 1935, and many of its details were reflected in Leo Fender's model).            The first factory model appeared in 1950 and was called the Esquire. Fewer than 50 guitars were initially produced under this brand, and most had to be replaced under warranty due to manufacturing problems in the early stages. In particular, the fingerboards did not have an adjustment anchor rod, and many guitars were returned due to bent fingerboards. Later, in 1950, the single pickup model was discontinued and the dual pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. From that point on, all Fender guitar fingerboards had anchor rods. Gretsch, itself a manufacturer of electric guitars (now owned by Fender), claimed that the Broadcaster used the trademark of their Broadcaster series of drums, and being new to the market, Fender decided to comply and changed the name to Telecaster, in honor of the Telecaster. Guitars made during the transition from Broadcaster to Telecaster had no name and are often referred to as Nocaster, meaning 'netcaster'. The Esquire was relaunched as a Telecaster with a single pickup, and these guitars were sold at a lower price.        </p> <p>The simple modular design created by Leo Fender was put into mass production. It simplified the maintenance and repair of electric guitars. Guitars were not assembled individually, as had traditionally been done in stringed musical instruments. Instead, component parts were produced in significant quantities quickly and at low monetary cost, and then assembled into a guitar on an assembly line. The body was machine sawed, unlike other guitars of the time whose bodies were made by hand. Instead of the traditional glued-in fingerboard, Fender used a fingerboard bolted to the body with four self-tapping screws. This simplified production and allowed the fingerboard to be quickly removed for repair and replacement. In addition, the classic Fender Telecaster fingerboard was made from a single piece of maple without a separate fingerboard, and the fretboard was cut directly into the maple surface - a very unusual approach at the time (guitars traditionally had rosewood or ebony fingerboards glued onto mahogany fingerboards). The electronics could be easily repaired and replaced via a removable panel, which was a big advantage over traditional designs where the electronics could be accessed through the resonator hole (for hollow guitars), or (later) by removing the faceplate after removing the strings (as in the Fender Stratocaster).            In its classic version, the guitar had a very simple construction, with the fingerboard made from a single piece of maple and screwed together with an ash or alder body. The electronics included two pickups controlled by a three-position switch. The pickguard was made of celluloid (later replaced by plastic) and bolted to the body with five (later eight) bolts.            The guitar quickly became popular, and soon other companies (such as Gibson, whose Les Paul was introduced in 1952, and later Gretsch, Rickenbacker, etc.) began working on their own solid wood models. A large chrome cover, often called an 'ashtray', was fitted over the bridge, but it is rarely seen, as most players feel it interferes with their playing style.        </p> <p>The Telecaster is known for its ability to produce a bright, rich tone or a warm, bluesy tone, depending on whether the bridge (bridge) or neck (guitar neck) pickup is selected. A pickup in the bridge position has a more 'wavy' sound than a pickup in the neck position, so it produces a stronger signal at the output, which is compensated for by the lower inductance of the pickup in this position. At the same time, the capacitor located on the tone control allows the musician to change the saturation of high frequencies directly while playing. The slanted pickup in the bridge position has more sound output compared to the pickup in the neck position. The one-piece body allows the guitar to reproduce the clean vibrations of the guitar strings.This was a change from previous hollow body guitar shapes which produced a lot of unwanted noise. Thus, the musician's solid body guitar shape lends itself to acoustic guitars, which is important in country music. </p> <p> Vintage Telecasters are valued more (as are other forms) than Stratocasters due to their specificity </p> </div>f:T3689,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Squier Statocaster</h4> <p> Squier is a subsidiary brand of Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Its models are mostly simplified versions of famous Fender guitars and are usually aimed at beginners. It is worth noting that some of the Squier guitars are sold at the same price as the original Fender guitars - Stratocaster, Telecaster, etc. Some famous musicians such as Eric Clapton have used Squier branded guitars.        </p> <p>Fender, being owned by CBS, got the Squier brand name in the mid to late 1960s by acquiring an American string company, but the purchased company was dormant for many years afterward. Before the Fender Squier series was introduced to the world in 1982, Fender had never before produced a lower-end guitar based on the Stratocaster and Telecaster instrument designs, and had always used other design choices for lower-end guitars.            In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fender faced off against Japanese competitors producing cheap guitars. Fender's lower-end guitars were made in the United States and could not compete with inexpensive Japanese copies. In the early 1980s, production costs and labor costs in Japan were lower than in America, and in order to compete with the Japanese guitar makers, Fender decided to move production of low-end guitars from the U.S. to Japan.            Another reason for moving production to Japan was the declining sales of Fender guitars in Japan, while sales of Japan's leading replica companies, such as Tokai and Greco, were growing. Thus, the creation of Fender Japan was to restore Fender's supremacy in sales of low-budget instruments both in Japan and worldwide.            Fender began discussions with several Japanese musical instrument distributors and reached an agreement with Yamano Gakki and Kanda Shokai for the eventual creation of a Fender Japan division. Yamano Gakki is also known for having previously been part of Epiphone Japan. Kanda Shokai owned the Greco trademark, and one of the terms of the agreement in creating Fender Japan was to stop producing replica Fender guitars under the Greco trademark.            This arrangement benefited Fender by removing Greco-branded replica Fender guitars from the market, which were sold at significantly lower prices than American-made Fenders, and also benefited Kanda Shokai, which in turn was able to distribute Japanese-made Fender instruments in Japan.            Subsequently, negotiations between Fender and the guitar factories came to an end.            Tokai was initially considered as the manufacturer of the first Japanese Fender guitars, but after the sudden termination of negotiations with Tokai, FujiGen[en] was chosen.            The first Fender guitars made in Japan were the Squier JV series. They were exact copies of classic Fender guitar models of the 1950s and 1960s. Soon a new lineup appeared, called SQ, which was reflected as a prefix in the serial numbers of these guitars. They were basically copies of the 1970s models, but the main difference from the JV series was the Japanese-made pickups, while the JVs had pickups made by Fender American. The Squier lineup slowly evolved to include instruments based on original designs unique to Squier, and production was moved from Japan to other Asian countries such as South Korea and China.            First appearing in Europe in the early 1980s, the Squier lineup consisted of copies of Fender's most popular models: the Stratocaster '57 and '62, Precision Bass '57 and '62, Telecaster '52 and Jazz Bass '62. They were created at the FujiGen Gakki factory in Japan, later manufactured by Ibanez using the original factory drawings. These early Squier instruments were referred to as the JV Squier series, according to the first two letters of the serial number on the plate through which the fingerboard was bolted to the body. This abbreviation stood for Japanese Vintage - literally, 'vintage instruments made in Japan'. The first shipments to Europe had a large handwritten Fender logo and a small Squier Series label on the fingerboard head, but soon the large Squier logo was placed on the fingerboard head with a small by Fender label. The early Squier JVs were very faithful reproductions of classic models, and are now highly prized by guitar collectors, especially European collectors.       Early Squier JVs were assembled from fingerboards and decks originally created for Fender replicas manufactured by Greco. Kanda Shokai had to stop making Fender replicas because part of the arrangement with Fender itself was to stop Greco competing with Fender Japan. Thus, unused Greco decks and fingerboards were given to FujiGen to assemble some of the Squier JV series instruments. Early Squier JVs were often equipped with American-made pickups such as the X-1 single-coil pickup found on American Fender models: the Lead II, Strat, and Dan Smith Stratocaster.            After Squier JV production ended, quality control of the instruments was greatly reduced. In order to reduce the cost of production, the guitar bodies were made of poplar and basswood, which were cheap analogs of alder, but basswood body gives a more balanced sound compared to alder and is better for playing with overdrive, but the so-called 'glass' is not enough - the instrument is less sonorous. Manufactured in Asia Squier had poor quality: the fretboard wore out quickly, the pegs did not hold the line well and quickly became unusable, the use of tremolo quickly upset the guitar. The switch and potentiometers were also short-lived. On some copies the bridge was incorrectly installed, as a result of which the guitar 'didn't build'. Many experienced guitarists advise to refinish guitars produced before September 2007, consisting in shielding electronics, changing pickups, potentiometers, switch, wires and stakes for better quality. Beginning in September 2007, Fender has made dramatic changes in Squier production and the quality of the product has reached a new level. State-of-the-art technology and controls at all stages of production have ensured that the probability of scrap is minimized and the cost of the final product is reduced. In addition, energy and transportation costs in the PRC are much lower than in the US, Europe or Japan, which contributes to lower production costs.        </p> <p>There are several Squier models that are quite different in specs from standard Fender models - such as the Super-Sonic, the Squier '51 (a design that combines elements of the Stratocaster, Telecaster and Precision Bass '51), and the Jagmaster (partially inherited from the Jazzmaster and Jaguar). The 'Bullet' name, currently used for Stratocaster models, was applied to the Stratocaster and Mustang short-coil hybrids in the early 1980s.            Squier's lineup also includes original variations of the Stratocaster and Telecaster guitar designs, such as the Hello Kitty Stratocaster (painted pink, with inlays on the fingerboard and the Hello Kitty logo), the OBEY Graphics series (Stratocaster and Telecaster models covered in hand-painted oil paintings), and signature Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley models.        </p> <p>Since 2007, Fender has positioned Squier as a brand name for budget reissues of its instruments (Bullet, Affinity, Standard series) and at the same time as a separate brand with original models not found in the Fender catalog. Some versions of the standard models are not shown below.            Electric guitars Affinity Affinity Stratocaster series, available with alder body (except for versions that come with guitar amps), maple fingerboard and rosewood fingerboard. (Three singles or two singles and a humbucker) Affinity Telecaster Affinity Jazzmaster (Two humbuckers) Affinity Starcaster (Two humbuckers) Bullet Bullet Strat Series (previously made of plywood, but later produced only with a body made of three longitudinally glued linden blocks, the plywood is eliminated completely, and the sound of the guitar has changed for the better). In 2010, the Squier Bullet by Fender became the best-selling instrument, far outstripping its competitors in North America and Europe. In addition to the standard model with three singles, Fender offered HSS (1 humbucker, 2 singles) and HH (2 humbuckers) models for fans of heavy music. The year of manufacture of a particular instrument can be determined by the serial number on the back of the fingerboard head - these are the first two digits (for example, 10 corresponds to the year of manufacture 2010). With these models, Fender has pushed out many famous guitar manufacturers, which for a long time steadily occupied the niche of relatively inexpensive instruments.        Fender Squier Contemporary Stratocaster Series This 2018 model is available with hss and hh, as well as complete with tremolo. The body of the guitar is made of poplar with a glossy polyurethane finish. The fingerboard is maple, 'C' profile, with a matte finish. Menzura - 25,5'', 22 fret Narrow Tall on the fingerboard. The new model features a Termanalia fingerboard inlaid with cream-colored dots.            Mass Market Squier Stratocaster HT Series, available with a paulownia body, maple fingerboard and laminated hardwood fingerboard. (Three singles) The Deluxe Deluxe Hot Rails Stratocaster looks like a regular Stratocaster with three singles, but in reality they are humbuckers (Seymour Duncan-Hot Rails HR-101) with the size of a standard Fender single. The sound of the instrument is very aggressive, the output is powerful but less transparent than a standard single, so it is more suitable for overdriven playing and is intended for heavy styles of music.

In 1903 Stathopoulos emigrated to the United States, where he continued the business. Initially the firm produced lutes and violins, later mandolins. Since 1915, after the death of the founder, the company was headed by his son Epi. After the First World War the company mastered the production of banjos, later - guitars. In 1943 Epi Stathopoulos passed away and the company was taken over by his brothers Orfei and Frixo.        </p> <p>In 1957, the firm was absorbed by Maurice Henry Berlin's Chicago Musical Instrument Company (CMI) (which had owned its main competitor in the archtop guitar market[en] Gibson since 1944), with models such as the Emperor, Deluxe, Broadway and Triumph considered by some musicians to be superior to Gibson products.            The most famous Epiphone model from the Gibson era was the Casino model. It was made in the same shape and configuration as the Gibson ES-330 guitars. The guitar has a very thick, rich sound that makes it perfect for rhythm guitar parts. This model gained widespread fame as the guitar used by John Lennon of The Beatles.            In the early 1970s, Epiphone instruments began to be manufactured in Japan, and in 1983 the production was transferred to South Korea. Since the 1980s, Epiphone guitars have been manufactured primarily in Korea, with licensed production in Japan, one of these licensees being Samick. In the early 2000s, production in Korea and Japan practically ceased; in 2002, Gibson opened a factory in the Chinese city of Qingdao, which exclusively produces guitars under the Epiphone brand. </p> </div>11:T2506,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Marshall Combo Amplifiers</h4> <p> Marshall is a British company that designs and manufactures music amplifiers, acoustic cabinets, personal headphones and earpieces, drums and bongos. The company also owns the record label Marshall Records. The company was founded in London by drum store owner and drummer Jim Marshall and is now based in Bletchley, Milton Keynes, England.            Marshall first developed his amplifiers in response to a complaint by Pete Townshend, guitarist for The Who, who visited the company's drum store, that the guitar amps on the market at the time did not have the right sound or enough volume. Many modern and reissued Marshall guitar amps still use valves (tubes) rather than transistors, as is common in this sector of the market. Marshall also produces solid state, hybrid (vacuum tube and solid state) and modeling amps.        </p> <p>After a successful career as a drummer and drum teacher, Jim Marshall first went into business in 1962, opening a small store in Hanwell, London, selling drums, cymbals and drum accessories; Marshall himself also gave drum lessons. According to Jim, Ritchie Blackmore, Big Jim Sullivan and Pete Townshend were the three main guitarists who frequented the store. They encouraged Marshall to build guitar amps and told him what kind of sound and design they wanted. Marshall Limited then expanded, hired designers and began making guitar amps to compete with existing amps, the best known of which at the time were Fender amps imported from the US.        </p> <p>Jim Marshall wanted someone to create a cheaper alternative to American-made guitar amps, but since he had little experience in electrical engineering, he enlisted the help of his store's repairman, Ken Branagh, a technician for Pan American Airways, and Dudley Craven, an EMI intern. They liked the sound of the 4×10-inch Fender Bassman best, and made several prototypes using the Fender Bassman amp as a model. The sixth prototype produced, in Marshall's words, 'the Marshall sound', although at that point Marshall's only involvement was selling amps on a commission basis in his store. As the business grew, Marshall asked all three to work for him in his store as he had more space and capital to expand.        </p> <p>The original idea was discussed late on a Friday night in early 1963 in the Wimpy Bar in Ealing in West London by three radio amateurs after they had been to a weekly meeting of a radio club in Greenford. Dudley Craven's call sign was G3PUN, Ken Branagh's was G3UDC and Ken Underwood's was G3SDW. After the deaths of Dudley in 1998 and Branagh in 2018, Ken Underwood is the sole owner of the original model. The first six production units were assembled in Branagh, Craven and Underwood's garden cottages that year at Heston, Hanwell and Hayes, located in West London. They were almost a copy of the Bassman circuit, with American military 5881 valves, relatives of the 6L6. Few speakers at the time could handle more than 15 watts, which meant that an amplifier of around 50 watts had to use multiple speakers to handle the power. For its Bassman, Fender used four ten-inch Jensen speakers in the same cabinet as the amplifier, but Marshall decided to separate the amplifier from the speakers and installed four 12-inch Celestion speakers in a separate enclosed cabinet instead of four 10-inch Jensen speakers in an open cabinet. Other significant differences included the use of higher-gain ECC83 valves in the preamp, and the introduction of a capacitor-resistor filter after the volume control. These circuit changes gave the amp more gain, so that it went into overdrive faster than the Bassman and boosted the treble. This new amp, tentatively called the 'Mark II', was eventually named the 'JTM 45', in honor of Jim and his son Terry Marshall and the amp's maximum power. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and other late 1960s blues-rock bands such as Free used Marshall stacks both in the studio and live on stage, making them some of the most sought-after and popular amps in the industry.        </p> <p>In 1965, Marshall signed a 15-year distribution agreement with the British company Rose-Morris, which gave him the capital to expand production, though it proved costly. In retrospect, Marshall admitted that the Rose-Morris deal was 'the biggest mistake I ever made'. Rose-Morris didn't have a clue. They added 55% to my price when I exported, which knocked us out of the world market for a long time.        </p> <p>The new contract disenfranchised several of Marshall's former distributors, including his old friend Johnny Jones. The contract didn't prohibit Marshall from making amplifiers outside the company, so Marshall launched the Park brand, inspired by Jones's wife's maiden name. To comply with the contract, these amplifiers had minor circuitry changes from the regular Marshall, as well as minor changes in appearance. For example, Parks often had silver or black front panels instead of gold Marshalls, some cabinets were taller or shaped differently, and controls were positioned and labeled differently.                From early 1965, Park produced several amplifiers, including a 45-watt head. Most had Marshall layouts and components, although some unusual amps were produced, such as a 75-watt keyboard amp with KT88 tubes. The 2×12-inch combo had the ability to send the first channel to the second, probably inspired by Marshall users who did the same trick with a jumper cable. The 1972 Park 75 produced about 100 watts due to two KT88s, while a comparable 50-watt 1987 model of the time used 2 EL34 tubes.                Park ceased to exist in 1982, although Marshall later revived the brand for some transistor amplifiers made in Asia. Park amplifiers produced from the mid-1960s to about 1974 ('the golden years'), with 'point-to-point' wiring - rumored to be 'a little hotter' than regular Marshall - are more expensive than comparable 'real' Marshall amplifiers of the same period.        </p> <p>Other brand names that Marshall Amplification used for various reasons included Big M (for the then West German market), Kitchen/Marshall (for the Kitchen Music retail chain in North London), Narb (Ken Branagh's surname spelled backwards) and CMI (Cleartone Musical Instruments). Amplifiers sold under these brands are quite rare and are sold to collectors at high prices.        </p> <p>In 2007, a group of Marshall employees split off and founded Blackstar Amplification.        </p> <p>To cut costs, Marshall began sourcing components from the UK. This led to the use of transformers made by Dagnall and Drake, and a switch to the KT66 valve instead of the 6L6 tube commonly used in the United States. These changes gave Marshall amplifiers a more aggressive voice, which quickly caught on with musicians like Eric Clapton, who sat in Jim's store practicing. Clapton asked Jim Marshall to build a tremolo combo amplifier that would fit in the trunk of his car, and one of Marshall's most famous amplifiers, the 'Bluesbreaker' amplifier, was born. It was this amp, in tandem with his 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard ('Beano'), that gave Clapton that famous tone on John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers' 1966 album 'Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton'.        </p> <p>Amplifiers of this era are easily recognized by their acrylic glass (aka Plexiglas) front panel, which earned them the nickname 'Plexi'. In 1967 Marshall released a 50-watt version of the 100-watt Superlead, known as the 1987 Model. In 1969 the Plexiglas panel was replaced by a brushed metal front panel.            Early buyers also included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose quest for extra volume led Marshall to create the classic 100-watt valve amplifier. Ken Bran and Dudley Craven, Marshall's designers, doubled the number of output valves, added a larger power transformer and an additional output transformer. Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Townshend, and in 1965 the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original Plexi, was born. At Townshend's request, Marshall built an 8×12-inch cabinet (soon replaced by a pair of 4×12-inch cabinets) to which the 1959 amp head was mounted, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock 'n' roll. The wall size of a Marshall stack 'soon became an indicator of a band's status', even as it became obsolete thanks to improved speaker systems; indeed, many of the 'ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabinets' included dummies. Nevertheless, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, although often incorporating many more features (or other valves, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 valves).        </p> <p>The KT66 valves were becoming increasingly expensive at this time, as M-OV faced increasing competition from Mullard. So another valve change was made: Marshall began using Mullard EL34 valves in the European-made power stage. They have a different overdrive character than the KT66, giving the Marshall a more aggressive voice. In 1966, Jimi Hendrix was in Jim's store, trying out amps and guitars. Jim Marshall expected Hendrix to be 'just another American looking to get something for nothing,' but to his surprise, Hendrix offered to buy the amplifiers at retail price if Jim would provide him with worldwide support. Jim Marshall agreed, and several of Hendrix's road crew were trained to repair and service Marshall amplifiers over the years. </p> </div>12:Tbc1,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Boss</h4> <p> Boss is a manufacturer of effects pedals for electric guitars and bass guitars. It is a division of Roland Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer specializing in music equipment and accessories. For many years Boss has produced a wide range of effects-related products for guitars, including 'compact' and 'dual' effects pedals, multi-effects pedals, electronic tuners and pedalboards. Boss have recently expanded their product range to include digital studios, rhythm machines, samplers and other electronic music equipment. They also now produce solid state amplifiers and acoustic heads such as the Waza and Katana. Both models feature multi-effects designed to mimic classic Boss effects pedals.        </p> <p>The earliest Boss product was called the B-100 The Boss and was released in 1974. It included a clip-on preamp and a pickup for amplifying acoustic guitars. At that time, the Boss company had not yet been formed and the unit was still a Beckmen Musical Instruments product (as seen on the B-100 box). The first true Boss effects pedal, the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, was released in June 1976 and was a separate unit of the chorus/vibrato circuitry used in the Roland JC-120 amplifier. It was a fairly large unit, powered by AC mains power. Other pedals from that year include the GE-10 (graphic equalizer), BF-1 (flanger), and DB-5 (distortion).        </p> <p>The Boss line of compact pedals began in 1977 with the release of six pedals, all of which have been discontinued: an overdrive pedal (OD-1), phaser pedal (PH-1), Spectrum parametric equalizer (SP-1), 6-band graphic equalizer (GE-6), compressor pedal (CS-1), and automatic wah pedal (TW-1). The Boss DS-1 pedal was released the following year, 1978. The first compact chorus pedal (CE-2) appeared in 1979, and the first flanger pedal (BF-2) appeared in 1980. In 1983, Boss released the DD-2 Digital Delay, the first mass-produced digital delay in a compact pedal format. The Metal Zone pedal (MT-2) was released in 1991. In 1992, Boss released nine new pedals, including the Turbo Distortion (DS-2). The Heavy Metal distortion pedal (HM-2) has been an integral part of the guitar sound of many styles of heavy metal music ever since. All pedals are the same size for pedal board compatibility.        </p> <p>In 2006, Boss incorporated COSM (Composite Object Sound Modeling), Roland's patented version of digital modeling technology, into its AC-3 Acoustic Simulator pedal. Since then, Boss has released several pedals utilizing COSM, including the FBM-1 '59 Fender Bassman pedal and the FDR-1 '65 Fender Deluxe Reverb pedal, introduced at Winter NAMM in January 2007.        </p> <p>The Boss compact pedals all use 'buffered bypass', a silent pedal switch that uses field-effect transistors (FETs) to avoid clicks and pops. Although not a 'real' bypass, buffered bypass has the advantage of preventing signal loss due to long cables while maintaining the original guitar tone.        </p> </div>13:T829,<div class='popup-item'> <h4>Fender HammerTone guitar pedals</h4> <p>Fender effects pedals are firmly established in the market. With the new Hammertone line, the American company is targeting budget-conscious buyers and introduces a total of nine pedals for everyday use. We present four of them here.        </p> <p>The first thing that catches the eye is, of course, the look. With its rustic hammer-on design and retro styling, this range clearly stands out from the stylish elegance of its larger and older brethren. The pedals are also relatively well organized. Our two disks have four pots each, reverb and echo have three each, and there are two small switches for selecting options. External control options are generally not available for this series.        </p> <p>The potentiometer knobs are based on the company's amp designs, and each unit is color-coded to describe the type of effect. While appearance is always a matter of taste, this approach is certainly original - even if it's not exactly the best solution in terms of readability. Three of our four test subjects can also be customized internally with controls. Which, as we'll see in a moment, makes perfect sense.        </p> <p>Let's start with the most 'bread-and-butter' pedal - almost every guitarist has an overdrive on board. In addition to the standard volume, distortion and tone controls, Fender has endowed its latest version with two additional features. Firstly, the 'Pre-Mid Boost' provides a midrange boost - for more assertiveness when soloing, for example - which can be added (but unfortunately not enabled). There's also a control in the cabinet that adjusts the response of the upper frequencies.        </p> <p>The pedal sounded too muffled to my ears in Ex mode, so during testing, the control was always turned all the way up, which gave the sound the spice it needed. The result is a versatile pedal for a wide range from blues to hard rock. Mid Boost opens up additional possibilities, but you have to decide in advance how much you want to integrate it into your sound.        </p> </div>8:["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","$L9",null,{"messages":{"HomePage":{"page_description":"Simple guitar amp based on","ir_description":"Load an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_response'>Impulse Response</a> file (you can grab it from <a href='https://tonehunt.org/all?filter=ir'>here</a> or some other place)","ir_hint":"*make sure to reset your IR before playing because when you change or turn on and off any effect, IR is gaining more volume","ir_reset":"reset current IR","sf_label":"Strict fretting","tuner_title":"Guitar tuner","tuner_label":"Tuner","tuner_hint":"*not affected by other effects; tuner is not 100% accurate at low frequencies (2^14 resolution <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform' target='_blank'>Fast Fourier Transform</a>)","A4_label":"A4 frequency value","CS_title":"Chord shapes","chord_name_placeholder":"Enter chord name...","chord_shape_placeholder":"Enter chord shape...","chord_key_placeholder":"Enter keyboard key name...","chord_submit":"Add chord","effects_title":"Effects","volume_label":"Volume","volume_hint":"*this effect also holds your distortion and gain effects, so change it, if you want to have only this effect on (from the previously mentioned effects)","volume_value_label":"Volume value (in Db)","distortion_label":"Distortion","distortion_value_label":"Distortion value (divided by 100%)","gain_label":"Gain","gain_value_label":"Gain value (in Db)","bitcrusher_label":"Bitcrusher","bitcrusher_value_label":"Bitcrusher resolution (in bits)","chorus_label":"Chorus","chorus_frequency_label":"Frequency","chorus_delay_label":"Delay","chorus_depth_label":"Depth","chorus_wet_label":"Wet","delay_label":"Echo delay","delay_hint":"*value of 1 is a looper","delay_value_label":"Delay value","reverb_label":"Reverb","reverb_hint":"*values above 150 requires a lot of RAM, setting this above 150 may cause browser to crash","reverb_value_label":"Reverb value","pitchshifter_label":"Pitch shifter","pitchshifter_value_label":"Pitch shifter value (in steps, 12 is 1 octave)","pitchshifter_wet_label":"Wet"},"SynthPage":{"page_description":"Simple digital synth based on ","presets_label":"Switch preset","presets_hint":"*drums' octaves are 3 and 4 (with no percussion)","presets_piano":"Piano","presets_drums":"Drums","leastoctave_label":"Least octave","keys_label":"Keys","octave_label":"Octave","addkey_label":"Add key","removekey_label":"Remove key","drummachine_label":"Drum machine (not implemented)","tapper_label":"Tap","sample_name_placeholder":"Enter sample name...","sample_note_placeholder":"Enter synth's note...","sample_submit":"Create","invalid_sample_note":"Note you've provided doesn't exist"},"SettingsPage":{"data_hint":"*Clearing browser's cache or sites' data will erase these settings","mapping_hint":"Please, write full name of key (if it is not one letter).<br/> All of these bindings are clickable so you can use instruments without a keyboard.
